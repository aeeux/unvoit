                When using UNVOIT to send invoices, it’s only possible with a
                simple contract between you and the customer every time they buy
                something from you. So if they accidentally send the wrong
                amount of money back to your invoice request, it won’t go
                through. But the same goes for you as a company; if you send an
                invoice request to a customer with information that is not the
                same as the contract both of you agreed upon, it won’t go
                through either. With blockchain technology, we are able to scan
                information between both parts, spot errors and always compare
                it to a secure contract form signed by you and the customer
                before any payment takes place. This will avoid human mistakes
                and possible fraud.
